Moves are in the following format:
l <g> <n>   -    bid n coins for god g.
p    -    pass (end your turn).
r <x> <y>    -    recruit a unit on tile (x,y).
m <x> <y> (after bidding for Zeus)   -    smite tile (x, y) (remove 1 unit from that tile).
m <x> <y> <n> <x2> <y2> (after bidding for Poseidon or Ares)    -    move n units from tile (x,y) to tile (x2, y2).
b <x> <y>    -    build on tile (x,y).
0    -    do not retreat from battle.
1 <x> <y>    -    retreat from battle to (x,y).
x <a> <b>    -    after bidding for Apollo gain 1 gold and if you were the first person to bid on him increase the income of tile (a,b).
<x> <y> (when building metropolis from philosophers) build metropolis on tile (x,y).
<x1> <y1> <s1> ... <x5> <y5> <s5> <x> <y> (when building metropolis from buildings) build metropolis on tile (x,y)
by deleting building in slots s1,s2,...,s5 of corresponding tiles (x1,y1),(x2,y2),...,(x5,y5).


Data recieved by a bot is in the following format:
Each line starts with an integer n.
If n is not negative the rest of the line is the move made by nth bot e.g. "2 l at 1" - bot 2 bid 1 coint for Athena.
If n = -2, then it is the bot's turn to play.
The rest of the line is a list of legal move separated by | e.g. "-2 1 1 1|0" - you can continue battle or retreat to (1,1).
If n = -3, then the bot performed an invalid move.
The rest of the line is the name of python exception caused by this move (currently always "InvalidMoveError").
If n = -5, then the last move performed was legal, the rest of the line is "ok".
If n = -7, then you have to build a metropolis.
The rest of the line is either "buildings" (if you had 4 distinct building types) or "philosophers" (if you had 4 philosophers).

All data shall be read from stdin and all moves shall be printed to stdout. 
Remember to flush the output buffer after printing each move!
